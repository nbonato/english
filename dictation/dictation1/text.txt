Tom had always wanted a bike. On his birthday, his parents surprised him with a brand new red bicycle. Tom was very happy and couldnâ€™t wait to ride it.

After breakfast, Tom put on his helmet and went outside. His dad helped him at first, holding the bike while Tom tried to balance. Tom wobbled a little but soon found his balance. He started to ride slowly down the street.

At first, he was nervous, but after a few minutes, he felt more confident. He rode around the park, waving to his friends. They all told him how cool his bike looked.

Tom rode all day, only stopping for lunch. He loved the feeling of the wind on his face. By the end of the day, he was very tired but excited to ride again tomorrow.
